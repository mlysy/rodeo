Time-varying Kalman filtering and smoothing algorithms. 

The Gaussian state space model underlying the algorithms is

.. math::

    x_n = c_n + Q_n x_{n-1} + R_n^{1/2} \epsilon_n

    y_n = d_n + W_n x_n + V_n^{1/2} \eta_n,

where :math:`\epsilon_n \stackrel{\text{iid}}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0, I_p)` and independently :math:`\eta_n \stackrel{\text{iid}}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0, I_q)`.  At each time :math:`n`, only :math:`y_n` is observed.  The Kalman filtering and smoothing algorithms efficiently calculate quantities of the form :math:`\theta_{m|n} = (\mu_{m|n}, \Sigma_{m|n})`, where

.. math::

    \mu_{m|n} = E[x_m \mid y_{0:n}]

    \Sigma_{m|n} = \text{var}(x_m \mid y_{0:n}),

for different combinations of :math:`m` and :math:`n`.
